# m2Giles' OS

[![Build m2os](https://github.com/m2Giles/m2os/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/m2Giles/m2os/actions/workflows/build.yml)

These are my customized versions of universal blue images for my needs. Everything is a tag off of m2os.

Bazzite is gnome version. Bazzite Desktop version includes nvidia drivers. ISOs are built for aurora/bazzite/cosmic and are artifacts.

Note, this is also a place I use to experiment before making changes in Universal Blue.
